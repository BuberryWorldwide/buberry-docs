# Carbon Points

## Overview

Carbon Points are a foundational metric token within the Buberry Worldwide ecosystem, designed to represent in-game actions that contribute to measurable real-world carbon sequestration. They serve as an educational and incentivizing tool, bridging gameplay with environmental impact.

## Earned Through

Carbon Points are rewarded for sustainable actions taken by users, including:

### 1. **Staking NFTs**

- Players stake Hero NFTs associated with tree-planting or other sustainability projects.
- The longer the staking period, the more Carbon Points are earned.

### 2. **Gameplay Tasks**

- **Planting Saplings**: Users earn Carbon Points for planting and nurturing trees.
- **Improving Land**: Actions like applying compost or mulch to degraded land contribute to earning points.

### 3. **Community Challenges**

- Participating in ecosystem-wide events such as "Plant 1,000 trees as a community" rewards individual contributions with Carbon Points.

## Use Cases

Carbon Points offer versatility and value within the ecosystem:

### 1. **Reducing Costs for Shop Items**

- Players can use Carbon Points to receive discounts on in-game purchases, such as saplings, tools, or resources.

### 2. **Conversion to Sustainability Tokens**

- Carbon Points can be converted into [[Sustainability Tokens]], providing players with governance power to influence real-world resource allocation.

### 3. **Tracking Individual Environmental Impact**

- Users can see the cumulative effect of their actions in terms of carbon offset.
- Example: "You have offset 50 kg of CO2 by planting saplings."

### 4. **Gamification Rewards**

- Unlock special badges, achievements, or exclusive NFTs based on Carbon Point milestones.

## Real-World Metrics

Carbon Points are directly tied to measurable sustainability outcomes:

### 1. **Carbon Sequestration**

- Each Carbon Point is linked to an estimated amount of CO2 offset.
- Example: 1 Carbon Point = 1 kg of CO2 sequestered, verified through tools like i-Tree.

### 2. **Impact Scaling**

- Larger actions, such as restoring multiple acres of land, earn more Carbon Points.
- Metrics are validated through third-party audits and partner organizations.

## Transparency and Validation

- All Carbon Points and their associated actions are logged on Hedera's public ledger, ensuring verifiability and trust.
- Progress updates, such as tree growth and survival rates, are provided to players through the Impact Dashboard.
