# Merit-Based Voting

## Overview

Merit-Based Voting in the Buberry Worldwide ecosystem ensures that governance decisions reflect meaningful contributions rather than financial influence. This system empowers players to participate in shaping the ecosystem’s direction by using [[Sustainability Tokens]] earned through active engagement and gameplay.

## How It Works

The voting system operates through a straightforward, merit-based process:

### Step 1: Earn [[Carbon Points]]

- Players perform in-game actions such as planting saplings, improving land, or participating in sustainability challenges.
- These actions generate [[Metric Tokens]], such as Carbon Points, reflecting their contributions.

### Step 2: Convert Metric Tokens into Sustainability Tokens

- Metric Tokens accumulated through gameplay are converted into [[Sustainability Tokens]] at a predefined rate.
- Example: 100 Carbon Points = 1 Sustainability Token.

### Step 3: Use Sustainability Tokens to Vote

- Players use their Sustainability Tokens to cast votes on:
    - Funding allocations for Farmer Heroes or sustainability projects.
    - Prioritization of new features, initiatives, or community goals.
- Each token represents one vote, ensuring proportional influence based on contributions.

### Example Voting Scenario

- Proposal: "Allocate $10,000 to Farmer Maria’s drought-resistant tree project."
- Players cast votes using Sustainability Tokens.
- The proposal with the highest votes receives funding, as outlined in [[Fund Allocation]].

## Transparency

Transparency is a cornerstone of the Merit-Based Voting system, ensuring fairness and accountability:

### Blockchain Integration

- All votes are logged immutably on the Hedera blockchain, preventing tampering or disputes.
- Each player can verify their vote via the transaction ID recorded on the ledger.

### Impact Dashboard

- Results of the voting process are displayed on the [[Impact Dashboard]]:
    - Funding recipients.
    - Metrics tied to the approved projects (e.g., CO2 offset, trees planted).

### Community Updates

- Regular updates keep users informed about how their votes translate into tangible outcomes.
    - Example: "Your votes helped Farmer Maria plant 300 trees, offsetting 1 ton of CO2 annually."
