# Fund Allocation

## Overview

Fund allocation within the Buberry Worldwide ecosystem is driven by transparency and community participation. Utilizing a smart-contract system on the Hedera blockchain, funds are distributed efficiently to support Farmer Heroes and sustainability projects. The process ensures that resources are allocated to impactful initiatives, with clear metrics to verify outcomes.

## Process

The fund allocation process is designed to balance community input with accountability. Below are the steps involved:

### Step 1: Proposal Submission

- **Farmer Heroes** or project leaders submit detailed proposals outlining:
    - Project goals (e.g., number of trees to plant, soil restoration area).
    - Required funding and estimated costs.
    - Expected sustainability metrics (e.g., CO2 offset, biodiversity impact).
- Proposals are uploaded to the platform and made accessible for community review.

### Step 2: Community Voting

- Players use their [[Sustainability Tokens]] to vote on proposals.
- Voting mechanics:
    - Each token equals one vote.
    - Proposals with the highest votes receive priority funding.
- Votes and results are logged on the Hedera blockchain for transparency.

### Step 3: Smart Contract Disbursement

- Funds are distributed in **milestones** tied to verifiable metrics:
    - **Initial Funding**: A portion of the funds is released to start the project.
    - **Milestone Verification**: Subsequent disbursements occur only after specific metrics are verified, such as:
        - Planting 50% of the proposed trees.
        - Soil organic matter increasing by a measurable amount.
    - Verification is conducted through partner organizations or tools like i-Tree.
- All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, allowing contributors to track fund usage.

## Transparency and Accountability

- **Impact Dashboard**:
    - Contributors can monitor real-time updates on funded projects, including progress and outcomes.
    - Example: "Farmer Mariaâ€™s project has planted 300 trees, sequestering 1 ton of CO2 annually."
- **Regular Reporting**:
    - Project leaders provide periodic updates, including photos, videos, and data.
    - Independent audits verify reported metrics where applicable.

## Benefits

1. **Community-Driven Decisions**:
    - Empowers players to influence real-world sustainability efforts.
2. **Efficient Resource Use**:
    - Milestone-based disbursement ensures funds are used effectively.
3. **Trust and Transparency**:
    - Blockchain technology provides immutable records of fund allocation and usage.
