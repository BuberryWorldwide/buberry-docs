# Project Workflow

## Pre-Funding

The pre-funding phase establishes a strong foundation for project success by assessing current conditions and planning for measurable outcomes.

### Key Activities:

1. **Proposal Submission**:
    
    - Farmer Heroes or project leaders submit detailed project proposals outlining:
        - Project goals and objectives (e.g., reforesting 5 hectares, restoring soil health).
        - Estimated budget and funding requirements.
        - Anticipated sustainability metrics (e.g., CO2 offset, biodiversity improvement).
2. **Baseline Metric Collection**:
    
    - Assess and record the initial environmental conditions using professional tools and methodologies:
        - **Trees Planted**: Count existing trees and record their species, size, and health.
        - **Soil Health**: Test organic matter levels, pH, and other fertility indicators.
        - **Water Retention**: Evaluate water usage and soil water-holding capacity.
    - Document findings and upload to the blockchain for transparency and verification.
3. **Validation and Approval**:
    
    - Validate proposals through peer review and endorsements from local organizations.
    - Approval is granted based on the feasibility and potential impact of the project.

## Funding

The funding phase ensures efficient and transparent resource allocation using blockchain technology:

### Key Activities:

1. **Community Voting**:
    
    - Users vote on submitted proposals using [[Sustainability Tokens]].
    - Proposals with the highest votes are prioritized for funding.
2. **Smart Contract Allocation**:
    
    - Resources are disbursed through Hedera-based smart contracts in milestone-based installments:
        - **Initial Funding**: A portion is released to begin the project.
        - **Subsequent Milestones**: Funds are unlocked as progress is verified (e.g., planting 50% of planned trees).
3. **Fund Transparency**:
    
    - All transactions are immutably recorded on the blockchain.
    - Contributors can track how their funds are used via real-time updates.

## Post-Funding

The post-funding phase focuses on measuring impact and ensuring long-term accountability:

### Key Activities:

1. **Impact Measurement**:
    
    - Utilize tools such as **i-Tree** to measure key outcomes:
        - **Carbon Sequestration**: Calculate CO2 offset by planted trees.
        - **Soil Regeneration**: Assess changes in organic matter and fertility.
        - **Biodiversity**: Track wildlife and native species return.
2. **Progress Reporting**:
    
    - Project leaders submit regular updates with:
        - Photos and videos documenting milestones.
        - Verified data reports from independent audits or partner organizations.
3. **Dashboard Updates**:
    
    - Contributors can view progress and outcomes on the [[Impact Dashboard]].
    - Example: "Farmer Hero Maria has planted 500 trees, offsetting 1.5 tons of CO2 annually."
4. **Community Engagement**:
    
    - Enable contributors to interact with Farmer Heroes through messages, Q&A sessions, or shared success stories.

## Benefits of the Workflow

1. **Accountability**:
    - Milestone-based funding ensures resources are used effectively.
2. **Transparency**:
    - Blockchain-based tracking builds trust in fund allocation and usage.
3. **Measurable Impact**:
    - Real-time reporting ensures projects deliver tangible environmental benefits.
